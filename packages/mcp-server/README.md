# @zplab/mcp-server

An MCP server that lets an assistant build ZPLab label drafts and turn them into ZPL.

## Tools

- `get_schema`: list the supported object types and their props.
- `create_draft`: build a design file from a size and a list of objects, with preflight warnings, per-object bounds, and bbox overlaps.
- `validate_draft`: parse a design file and return schema errors, preflight warnings, per-object bounds, and bbox overlaps.
- `export_zpl`: parse a design file and return its generated ZPL.
- `validate_zpl`: parse raw ZPL (one page per `^XA` block) and report object/page count, detected label, parser findings, preflight warnings, per-object bounds, and bbox overlaps.
- `import_zpl`: parse raw ZPL into an editable design file (one page per `^XA` block, overlays preserved for verbatim re-export) plus parser findings, per-object bounds, and bbox overlaps.
- `open_in_app`: push a design file into the running ZPLab desktop app. Only registered when the app spawned the server (HTTP mode), so it is absent over stdio.
- `get_current_design`: read back the design currently open in the desktop app, with render-measured bounds (nothing `approx`). App-spawned HTTP mode only.

Bounds are dots (visual top-left); `approx` marks headless estimates (barcode
footprints and single-line text), not render-measured. Overlaps are raw bbox
intersections, not errors: a frame/reverse box overlaps its contents by design.
Geometry is bounded on hostile input: a page past 2000 objects skips its
geometry and overlaps are capped, both flagged by `geometryTruncated`. Raw ZPL
over 256 KB is rejected (`ok: false`).

## Run

```
pnpm --filter @zplab/mcp-server exec tsx src/index.ts
```

Default transport is stdio. Passing `--http` serves the Streamable HTTP transport
instead, bound to `127.0.0.1` only:

```
pnpm --filter @zplab/mcp-server exec tsx src/index.ts --http --port 4923 --token <token>
```

`--port` and `--token` are both required with `--http`. Every request must carry
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`; loopback-only binding plus Origin/Host checks
guard against local drive-by and DNS-rebinding.
